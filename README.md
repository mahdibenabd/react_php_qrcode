# ReactJS PHP QR Code Project

This project combines a React front end with PHP backend, utilizing QR codes for various functionalities.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the React project.
- For PHP, make sure you have a web server installed (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and PHP installed on your system.

## Running the React Project

1. **Navigate to the React project directory:**

`cd path/to/your/reactjs_php_qrcode`

2. **Install the project dependencies using npm:**

`npm install`

3. **Start the React development server:**

`npm start`


- This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Installing the PHP Backend

1. **Set up your web server:**
- If using Apache, you can place your PHP files in the `htdocs` or `www` directory of your web server.
- If using Nginx, create a new site configuration and link it to your PHP directory.

2. **Configure the PHP server:**
- Update the `config.php` file with the necessary database connection details.

3. **Start your PHP server (if applicable):**
- For Apache, start the server with `sudo service apache2 start`.
- For Nginx, you typically don't need to start it as it's always running, but you need to configure the site and check the syntax with `sudo nginx -t`.
